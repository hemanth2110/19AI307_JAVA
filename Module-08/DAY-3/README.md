# Ex.No:8(C)             FILTER READER
## AIM:
To read a file, skip a certain number of bytes using skip(), and check the number of available bytes using available().

## ALGORITHM :

1. Create a `FileInputStream` to open the file `sample.txt`.
2. Wrap the `FileInputStream` with a `BufferedInputStream` (which extends `FilterInputStream`) to enhance file reading performance.
3. Use `Scanner` to take input from the user, specifying how many bytes to skip.
4. Use the `available()` method to check the number of bytes left to read in the file before and after skipping.
5. Close both the `FileInputStream` and `FilterInputStream` (BufferedInputStream) once the operations are complete.

         System.out.println("Available bytes in the file: " +filter.available());
         filter.skip(sk);
          System.out.println("Available bytes in the file: " +filter.available());
  file1.close();  
        filter.close();
