# Ex.No:8(A)           IO-FILE STREAM
## AIM:
To write a string to a file using FileOutputStream and handle resource closure using finally.

## ALGORITHM :

1. Define a string `data` to write into a file.
2. Initialize `FileOutputStream` to create or open the file `testout.txt`.
3. Convert the string to a byte array using `getBytes()`.
4. Write the byte array to the file using `f.write(b)`.
5. Ensure the file stream is closed in the `finally` block to prevent resource leaks.
