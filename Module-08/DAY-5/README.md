# Ex.No:8(E)  File Writing with FilterOutputStream

## AIM:
To write a specified range of bytes from a string to a file using FilterOutputStream.
## ALGORITHM :
1. Create a `FileOutputStream` to open or create the file `testout.txt`.
2. Wrap the `FileOutputStream` with a `FilterOutputStream` to provide additional functionality for output.
3. Read a string from the user using `Scanner` and convert it to a byte array using `getBytes()`.
4. Prompt the user to enter two integers: `first` (the starting index) and `second` (the number of bytes to write).
5. Write a portion of the byte array (from `first` index to `first + second`) to the file using `filter.write(b, first, second)`.
6. Close both the `FilterOutputStream` and the `FileOutputStream` to release resources.

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
String str = sc.nextLine();
byte[] b= str.getBytes();
int first = sc.nextInt();
int second = sc.nextInt();
filter.write(b,first,second);
filter.close();
