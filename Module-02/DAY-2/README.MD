# Ex.No:2(B) ACCESS MODIFIERS

## AIM:
To print all numbers divisible by 7 from 100 to 1 in descending order.

## ALGORITHM :
1. Start the program and define the main method.

2. Use a for loop starting from 100 down to 1.

3. For each number i, check if it is divisible by 7 (i % 7 == 0).

4. If the condition is true, print the number followed by a comma.

5. Continue the loop until i reaches 1, then end the program.
## PROGRAM:
